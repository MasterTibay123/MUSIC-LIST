<p>The Journey</p>
<br>
<p>Half the world is sleeping</p>
<p>Half the world's awake</p>
<p>Half can hear their hearts beat</p>
<p>Half just hear them break</p>
<p>I am but a traveler, in most every way</p>
<p>Ask me what you want to know</p>
<p>What a journey it has been</p>
<p>And the end is not in sight</p>
<p>But the stars are out tonight</p>
<p>And they're bound to guide my way</p>
<p>When they're shining on my life</p>
<p>I can see a better day</p>
<p>I won't let the darkness in</p>
<p>What a journey it has been</p>
<p>I have been to sorrow</p>
<p>I have been to bliss</p>
<p>Where I'll be tomorrow</p>
<p>I can only guess</p>
<p>Through the darkest desert</p>
<p>Through the deepest snow</p>
<p>Forward, always forward, I go</p>
<p>What a journey it has been</p>
<p>And the end is not in sight</p>
<p>But the stars are out tonight</p>
<p>And they're bound to guide my way</p>
<p>When they're shining on my life</p>
<p>I can see a better day</p>
<p>I won't let the darkness in</p>
<p>What a journey it has been</p>
<p>Forward, always forward</p>
<p>Onward, always up</p>
<p>Catching every drop of hope</p>
<p>In my empty cup</p>
<p>What a journey it has been</p>
<p>And the end is not in sight</p>
<p>But the stars are out tonight</p>
<p>And they're bound to guide my way</p>
<p>When they're shining on my life</p>
<p>I can see a better day</p>
<p>I won't let the darkness in</p>
<p>What a journey it has been</p>
<p>What a journey it has been</p>
