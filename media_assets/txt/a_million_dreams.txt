<p>A Million Dreams</p>
<br>
<p>I close my eyes and I can see</p>
<p>The world that's waiting up for me</p>
<p>That I call my own</p>
<p>Through the dark, through the door</p>
<p>Through where no one's been before</p>
<p>But it feels like home</p>
<p>They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy</p>
<p>They can say, they can say I've lost my mind</p>
<p>I don't care, I don't care, so call me crazy</p>
<p>We can live in a world that we design</p>
<p>Cause every night I lie in bed</p>
<p>The brightest colours fill my head</p>
<p>A million dreams are keeping me awake</p>
<p>I think of what the world could be</p>
<p>A vision of the one I see</p>
<p>A million dreams is all it's gonna take</p>
<p>Oh a million dreams for the world we're gonna make</p>
<p>There's a house we can build</p>
<p>Every room inside is filled</p>
<p>With things from far away</p>
<p>The special things I compile</p>
<p>Each one there to make you smile</p>
<p>On a rainy day</p>
<p>They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy</p>
<p>They can say, they can say we've lost our minds</p>
<p>I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy</p>
<p>Runaway to a world that we design</p>
<p>Every night I lie in bed</p>
<p>The brightest colours fill my head</p>
<p>A million dreams are keeping me awake</p>
<p>I think of what the world could be</p>
<p>A vision of the one I see</p>
<p>A million dreams is all it's gonna take</p>
<p>Oh a million dreams for the world we're gonna make</p>
<p>However big, however small</p>
<p>Let me be part of it all</p>
<p>Share your dreams with me</p>
<p>You may be right, you may be wrong</p>
<p>But say that you'll bring me along</p>
<p>To the world you see</p>
<p>To the world I close my eyes to see</p>
<p>I close my eyes to see</p>
<p>Every night I lie in bed</p>
<p>The brightest colours fill my head</p>
<p>A million dreams are keeping me awake</p>
<p>A million dreams, a million dreams</p>
<p>I think of what the world could be</p>
<p>A vision of the one I see</p>
<p>A million dreams is all it's gonna take</p>
<p>A million dreams for the world we're gonna make</p>
<p>For the world we're gonna make</p>
<p>For the world we're gonna make</p>
