<p>Thank you for teaching me how to love</p>
<p>Showing me what the world means</p>
<p>What I've been dreamin' of</p>
<p>And now I know, there is nothing that I could not do</p>
<p>Thanks to you</p>
<br>
<p>For teaching me how to feel</p>
<p>Showing me my emotions</p>
<p>Letting me know what's real</p>
<p>From what is not</p>
<p>What I've got is more that I'd ever hoped for</p>
<o>And a lot of what I hope for is</p>
<p>Thanks to you</p>
<br>
<p>No mountain, no valley</p>
<p>No time, no space</p>
<p>No heartache, no heartbreak</p>
<p>No fall from grace</p>
<p>Can't stop me from believing</p>
<p>That my love will pull me through</p>
<p>Thanks to you</p>

<p>That my love will see me through</p>

<p>Thanks to you</p>
<br>
<p>For teaching me how to live</p>
<p>Putting things in perspective</p>
<p>Showing me how to give</p>
<p>And how to take</p>
<p>No mistake</p>
<p>We were put here together (thanks to you)</p>
<p>And if I breakdown</p>
<p>Forgive me but it's true (thanks to you)</p>
<p>That I'm aching with the love I feel inside</p>
<p>Thanks to you, you</p>
<p>Thanks to you</p>
