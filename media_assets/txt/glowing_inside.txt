<p>Happy, to let you know</p>

<p>I feel so good, it's true</p>
<p>So glad that I have you</p>
<p>You love me so</p>
<p>Now all is bright</p>
<br>
<p>I'll always thank you for the glow</p>
<p>And thank you for the joy</p>
<p>Thank you for the love you give to me</p>
<p>I'm glowing, glowing inside</p>
<p>With your love shining through</p>
<p>Thank you for everything you do</p>
<p>I'm glowing inside because of you</p>
<br>
<p>Remember, my growing years</p>
<p>They're filled with joy</p>
<p>Because you're there for me</p>

<p>Because of you I'll sore up high</p>
<p>So I must</p>
<br>
